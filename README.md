# Practice for learning github!

My main goal for this class is to feel more comfortable with data science. I initially joined the class because I wanted a more formal introduction to R, but I'm excited for everything outside of that.

Reproducibility is important to me because I still feel very new to research. Even if I don't want to reproduce a study myself, it is helpful that that information is available and I can get examples of how things should be done
